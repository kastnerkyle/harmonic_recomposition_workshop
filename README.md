run `tar xzf samples.tar.gz` to get the full samples directory, including npz files with all sampling artifacts, conditioning chords and so on.

If some samples seem empty, check the png renderings. The markovm1 (spatial condioned) samples tender to have long silences.

Code release will be provided at a later date (TBD)
